    • Expected a lifted variable, but the following variable is unlifted:
      • x :: Int# :: TYPE 'IntRep
      NB: variables used in parallel list comprehensions must be lifted.
    • In a stmt of a list comprehension:
        Just (I# x) <- xs |  I# y <- ys
      In the expression: [I# (x +# y) | Just (I# x) <- xs |  I# y <- ys]
      In an equation for ‘gore’:
          gore xs ys = [I# (x +# y) | Just (I# x) <- xs |  I# y <- ys]
